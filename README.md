# COS-730-Ass

## Project Description
BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) was an instant messaging application originally designed exclusively for BlackBerry devices. Launched in 2005 by BlackBerry Limited, BBM quickly became a hallmark of the BlackBerry experience, particularly popular among business users for its secure communication features.

Despite its initial success, BBM faced significant competition from other messaging services like WhatsApp and iMessage, leading to a decline in its user base. The service was known for its robust security features, real-time delivery and read receipts, and group chat functionalities. BBM’s use of PIN-based user identification provided an additional layer of privacy and security

## Project Management
For project management, Agile methodology was employed, complemented by a Kanban board. This approach facilitated continuous delivery and improvement, allowing for effective adaptation throughout the development process. The Kanban board provided clear visibility of tasks, categorizing them into stages such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This ensured efficient tracking of work, enabling seamless collaboration and prioritization of tasks, ultimately streamlining the development workflow.

## Software architecture
### Model-View-Controller
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. This separation ensures that each component has a specific responsibility, making the code base more organized and easier to maintain. MVC promotes component reuse by separating data, presentation, and control logic. Models can be reused for data operations, views for different representations, and controllers for common behaviour. This improves code maintainability and provides a consistent user experience.

### Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is an architectural pattern that promotes the production,detection, consumption, and reaction to events. In this pattern, components of the system communicate with each other through events, enabling a more decoupled and scalable system. This separation ensures that each component can operate independently, making the code base more organized and easier to maintain. EDA promotes component reuse and scalability by allowing components to act upon events asynchronously

### Layered Architecture
Layered Architecture is an architectural pattern that separates an application into different layers, each with a specific responsibility. This pattern ensures that each layer has a distinct role, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain. Layers can interact with each other in a well-defined manner, promoting clear separation of concerns and modularity.

This architecture ensures that the BBM system is organized, maintainable, scalable, and secure, providing a consistent and high-quality user experience. Each layer can be developed, tested, and scaled independently, improving the overall system’s flexibility and robustness.
